# AEEIncidentsPython


AEEIncidents made in Python with suds, this is based on the Ruby "version" I made. Minified version, only works in terminal. 
I am also going to do a sort of API with this by using Djando, it is on its way.

The basic script is: **breakdownreport.py**

Requirements

* Python 2.7.*

How to run the basics scripts
===========

* Done!
